# ADR 0001: Use .Populate(name) instead of $lookup

Status:  
Date: 9/9/2025

## Context
Populate (Mongoose) – application-side join, convenience, multiple queries.
$lookup (Aggregation) – database-side join, single query pipeline, more control.

## Descision
  since $lookup is harder to implement for me and its a small project, 
  it would be more wise to use populate, because really, only one person will use it.

## Consequences

- Positive
 - easier development

- Negative
  - When there are a lot of foods and days then populate 
  will take much longer to complete, slowing down the server.
