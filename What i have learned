1. you have to get better at problem solving.
 this will simply make you a better programmer. it will help you organize code much better, create algorithims and solutions to problems that will make your code clean.

2. there is something weirdly wrong about the entire project. like a vibe of bad written code. 
i think it comes from my belief and real proof that i write code that is hardly maintanable. 
i should learn how to write good code from someone or read a book about it.
