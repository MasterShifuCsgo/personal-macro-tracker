# ADR 0001: Use JOI for type checking

Status: Undefined
Date: 11/9/2025

## Context
writing if statements over and over again, making a function 80% just type checking just creates Tech debt.

## Descision
type checking takes up a lot of real estate in the function.
Keeping the funcitons short would increase the readability of code, thus increasing code quality.

## Consequences

- Positive
 - only need to check if object exists.
 - no need for type checking because its automatic.

- Negative
  - no more descriptive strings for errors. librariy ones are sent instead.
