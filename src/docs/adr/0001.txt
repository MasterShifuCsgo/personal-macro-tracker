# ADR 0001: Use MongoDB for Project Database

Status: Accepted
Date: 8/9/2025

## Context
need an easy and understandable way of storing food and day data.
SQL database does not allow such simplicity.

## Descision
  I will use MongoDB because it's simplicity of holding required database
  It will be hosted locally and in atlas.

## Consequences

- Positive
 - easier development, no tinkering with SQL

- Negative
  - No strict schema enforcement: Use ODM like mongoose
  - You dont know mongoDB
